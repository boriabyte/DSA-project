Used fundamental data structures, linked list and binary tree, to implement a simulation of a game level map design, creating my own premise.

Values, stored in auxiliary arrays randomly according to a pseudo-random algorithm of my own (by juggling with values in another array), would be stored in a singly linked list and would randomly be assigned positions in a binary tree structure, afterwards being printed in preorder manner.
